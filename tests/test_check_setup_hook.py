"""The SessionStart hook's one-line status.

It is shell, it duplicates whisper.resolve_backend()'s precedence in bash, and
until now nothing tested it — which is how it came to announce an API backend to
a user who had pinned `local`. Every dependency it probes is stubbed onto PATH:
`command -v` and the python3 spawn are the only things it looks at, so a fake
python3 that exits 0 or 1 controls has_local_whisper exactly, without depending
on whether the developer's machine happens to have faster-whisper installed.

    backend is not usable here — install it, or set the matching API key" is
    exactly right for it. `MOVIOLA_WHISPER=mlx` is not a backend at all:
    `get_config` drops it and resolves as if nothing were pinned, there is
    nothing to install, and there is no matching key to set. The hook said the
    same sentence to both, and it was the only thing either user was ever told,
    because `get_config` discarded the value in silence.

    The case arm is cross-pinned to `config.WHISPER_BACKENDS` below rather than
    re-listed here. The hook already spells `local`, `groq` and `openai` in bash

        `get_config` reporting what it discarded, and `moviola.py` printing it,
        are pinned in `test_an_unrecognised_setting_is_reported.py`. The two
        surfaces are fixed together and tested apart, which is what would catch
        one of them regressing alone.
      * **The legitimate configurations it must not fire on** are every name in
        `WHISPER_BACKENDS`, including `auto` and including a differently-cased
        spelling of a real one. Asserted below rather than left implicit.

    """A value the user did not have to type into a file still reaches stdout.

    Everything this hook echoes lands verbatim in an agent's context, prefixed
    `/moviola: ` by the script itself — so a foreign value that can end the line
    it sits in can start a new one that is indistinguishable from something
    moviola said. That is the same defect
    `test_an_unrecognised_setting_is_reported.py::test_the_value_cannot_end_the_line_it_sits_in`
    closes on the Python side with `untrusted.stderr_line`; bash cannot import
    that module, so the hook applies the line-break half of the same rule — all
    of `untrusted.LINE_BREAKS` become spaces — in shell, once, immediately after
    the value is read — and appends the same bidi terminators as
    `untrusted.balance_bidi`.

    The two ways in are not equally dangerous and only one of them was ever
    reachable. `read_flag` consults the process ENVIRONMENT before the config
    file, and an environment variable may legally hold a newline; the config-file
    fallback is an `awk` parse that is line-oriented and does `print $2; exit`,
    so it structurally cannot produce one. Every case below therefore drives
    `extra_env`, not `env_body` — a payload written into the file cannot survive
    the parse to be tested.

    The notice this fires is also the newly reachable one. It prints BEFORE the
    `SETUP_COMPLETE=true` early exit, so a fully-configured install went from
    saying nothing at all about an unrecognised pin to printing a line built
    around it; that state is asserted below rather than left to the general case.

    NON-GOALS, so a green run is not read as more than it is:

      * **Structure, not meaning** — the same limit `stderr_line` documents. A
        setting whose value reads like an instruction is still legible text in
        an agent's context, correctly kept on one line.
      * **It fences line breaks, not markdown.** The hook's output is a plain
        status line, not a report, so there is no backtick rule here and none is
        asserted — that half is `md_inline`'s and belongs to stdout.
      * **Balancing a bidi scope is not stripping bidi controls.** The value can
        still reorder itself, and implicit directional marks have no scope to
        close. This confines an opened scope to the value, exactly as the
        canonical helper does; it does not make the value visually honest.
      * **The legitimate configuration it must not fire on** is an ordinary
        unrecognised value, which must still be shown back in full and in the
        user's own spelling. A fix that stripped or escaped characters would
        pass the hostile case and make the notice useless for the typo it exists
        to explain. Asserted below rather than left implicit.
      * **It says nothing about the OTHER settings the hook reads.**
        `read_flag` is shared, so `GROQ_API_KEY` and friends arrive by the same
        route — but the hook reports only whether those are present, never their
        value, so there is nothing of theirs on stdout to forge with. That is a
        property of the call sites, not of `read_flag`, and nothing here would
        notice a new site that echoed one.
      * It cannot see a forged line that contains no line break — a value that
        merely reads like a status is fenced correctly and still legible.
