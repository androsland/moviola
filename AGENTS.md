# moviola

Agent Skills package that gives an agent a video input. Installable across Claude Code (most common host), Codex, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and 50+ other [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) hosts. Pure-stdlib Python that orchestrates `yt-dlp` + `ffmpeg` and an optional Whisper API.

## Structure

- `skills/moviola/SKILL.md` — canonical skill contract the model reads when `/moviola` fires. Source of truth for behavior across every host.
- `skills/moviola/scripts/moviola.py` — entry point; orchestrates download → frames → transcript.
- `skills/moviola/scripts/{download,frames,transcribe,whisper,local_whisper,setup,config}.py` — yt-dlp wrapper, ffmpeg frame extraction + auto-fps, caption/Whisper transcription, on-device faster-whisper backend, preflight/installer, shared config.
- `skills/moviola/scripts/untrusted.py` — leaf module holding the structural edits and guarded parses applied to values this program did not write (`LINE_BREAKS`, `balance_bidi`, `stderr_line`, `stderr_block`, `finite_float`, `json_object`). The two stderr shapes are not interchangeable: `stderr_line` makes a short foreign value incapable of ending a line moviola wrote, while `stderr_block` keeps a captured subprocess stderr's structure and prefixes every line of it. `finite_float` and `json_object` are the same question one level apart: whether a VALUE inside somebody else's document is a number, and whether there is a document at all. Imported by `moviola.py`, `whisper.py`, `local_whisper.py`, `frames.py` and `workdir.py`; it imports nothing of theirs, which is what keeps it out of an import cycle. New fences and new parses of somebody else's output belong here, not in a caller.
- `skills/moviola/scripts/workdir.py` — leaf module holding the working directory exclusively for the life of the run (`flock` over `.moviola.lock`). `moviola.py` calls `workdir.hold(work)` once, before anything is written; two runs sharing one `--out-dir` overwrite each other's `video.*` and `frame_*.jpg`, and the stale-file guard cannot tell whose file is whose, so the second run is refused rather than reported on. Advisory and POSIX-only — see its NON-GOALS.
- `skills/moviola/scripts/build-skill.sh` — builds `dist/moviola.skill` for claude.ai upload (dev-only).
- `hooks/` — shared Claude Code and Codex SessionStart setup-status hook.
- `.claude-plugin/` — `plugin.json` + `marketplace.json` (Claude Code plugin + local marketplace).
- `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` — Codex plugin manifest; `"skills": "./skills/"` points Codex at the self-contained skill folder.
- `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` — Codex marketplace listing whose repo-relative `source.path` points at the repo-root plugin.
- `CLAUDE.md` → `@AGENTS.md` — generic-agent entry point.
- `tests/` — pytest suite (ffmpeg-synthesized clips; no network).
- `requirements-ci.txt` — the hash-pinned test toolchain CI installs. Not a
  package manifest: moviola has no runtime dependencies and shells out to
  `yt-dlp`/`ffmpeg` as binaries. `.github/workflows/drift.yml` installs the same
  packages unpinned on a weekly schedule, so upstream movement is reported
  separately rather than landing in a pull request.

## Orientation

- The product is the slash-command-invoked skill (`/moviola <url-or-path> [question]`), not a CLI. `scripts/moviola.py` is implementation. Features must work across every harness the skill installs into, not just Claude Code.
- **The skill is one self-contained folder: `skills/moviola/`.** SKILL.md and `scripts/` are siblings inside it. This is what lets `npx skills add` copy a working skill as a unit — do NOT move SKILL.md or `scripts/` back to the repo root, or non-Claude installers will copy SKILL.md without the scripts.
- **Path resolution is harness-agnostic.** SKILL.md resolves `SKILL_DIR` as the directory of the SKILL.md the model just Read, then runs `${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/...`. Do NOT reintroduce `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` (Claude-Code-only) — it is unset on Codex/Cursor/agents and breaks every script call there.
- **No `commands/` wrapper.** `/moviola` is derived from SKILL.md frontmatter (`name: moviola` + `user-invocable: true`). A separate command file creates a duplicate slash command.

## Install surfaces

| Surface | Install |
|---------|---------|
| Claude Code | `/plugin marketplace add androsland/moviola` then `/plugin install moviola@moviola` |
| Codex | `codex plugin marketplace add androsland/moviola --ref main` then `codex plugin add moviola@moviola` |
| Cursor / Copilot / +50 | `npx skills add androsland/moviola -g` |
| claude.ai (web) | upload `dist/moviola.skill` (built by `skills/moviola/scripts/build-skill.sh`) |

## Commands

```bash
# Tests (stdlib + pytest; ffmpeg required for frame tests). Python 3.10+ —
# the floor is the test toolchain (pytest and yt-dlp both declare
# `Requires-Python >= 3.10`), not the scripts, which parse under 3.7.
# CI runs 3.10 and 3.13 against the hash-pinned set in requirements-ci.txt.
python3 -m pytest -q               # or: .venv/bin/pytest -q, if you made one

# Build the claude.ai upload bundle (archives skills/moviola/ as the bundle root)
bash skills/moviola/scripts/build-skill.sh   # → dist/moviola.skill

# Dev: mirror the working tree into the installed Claude Code plugin cache
./dev-sync.sh                       # --dry-run to preview
```

## Rules

- Keep the version in sync across `skills/moviola/SKILL.md` (frontmatter), `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, and `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` when cutting a release.
- Releasing: tag `vX.Y.Z` and push the tag; `.github/workflows/release.yml` builds `dist/moviola.skill` and attaches it to the GitHub release.
- Never commit real API keys or `.env` contents; keys live in `~/.config/moviola/.env` (mode `0600`) at runtime.
